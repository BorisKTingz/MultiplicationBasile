# MultiplicationBasile
Project for my son and my daughter to learn multiplication and addition. It's the excuse and a side pleasure effect of the following goal:
# Playing With Gradle
This project is used to explain and show how to use Gradle on Android projects to reach a production level quality. At least for the delivery process and the quality tools you run on the project.
To be able to do that, some knowledge on Gradle is needed. We use a project with several dimensions of flavors, to play the game for real.  
But code without explanations sometimes is not enough, so you can find also a book called "Playing with Gradle". You can download it for free and I don't even ask for registration. Just use it, learn, enhance your skill and job's done.

I wrote this book, because this year I had to face a complex projects with several levels of goals and I get the job's done mainly with Gradle . It saved my life more than once on the project. But I have to admit, Gradle on Android is hard to learn. It's like exploring a big city with a map without euclidian geometry neither readable characters. So starting with Gradle on Android is sometimes a big pain. So I try, through the book and the project to make our life less painless. Hope it will.
Allez, La bise.
